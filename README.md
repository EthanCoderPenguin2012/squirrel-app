This is a stupid app I made that it literally just an image of an unclosable squirrel.
Features:

Added Squirrel
thats it
Oh, and don't worry! A pro version is coming soon with way more features.

_Note: windows defender says its dangerous, but its not. I made it myself and it's open source so you can even see the code_

























































(Please use this responsibly. Also it _is_ closable via task manager and by pressing `F9`.
